# Email Permutator

A simple Python script to generate email permutations from a list of names and a specified domain. This tool can be useful for generating various email formats for testing or data gathering purposes.

## Overview

The `email_permutator` script reads names from a file, generates possible email permutations based on those names and a provided domain, and outputs the results to either the console or an output file. 

## Features

- Reads names from a text file with each line containing a first and last name.
- Generates multiple email permutations for each name based on the given domain.
- Allows saving results to a specified file or prints to the console.
- Customizable email formats through the `email_permuter` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `permutations` module (assumed to contain the `email_permuter` function)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rmail-Permutator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Email-Permutator
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed and any necessary modules (e.g., `permutations`) are available in your environment. If you need to install the `permutations` module, make sure it's accessible to the script.

## Usage

The script is executed from the command line and takes the following arguments:

```bash
python email_permutator.py <file> <domain> [-o <output_file>]
```

### Arguments

- `<file>`: Path to the text file containing names (one name per line, formatted as "FirstName LastName").
- `<domain>`: Email domain to use for generating permutations (e.g., `example.com`).
- `-o <output_file>` (optional): Path to the output file where results will be saved. If not specified, results will be printed to the console.

### Example

Given a file named `names.txt` with the following content:

```
John Doe
Jane Smith
```

And running the command:

```bash
python email_permutator.py names.txt example.com -o emails.txt
```

The `emails.txt` file might contain:

```
john.doe@example.com
j.doe@example.com
doe.john@example.com
jane.smith@example.com
j.smith@example.com
smith.jane@example.com
```
